# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Objective

The purpose of this activity was to use GeoJson and API's to create a functioning map with various levels showing earhquakes with magnitudes, and tectonic plates.


## Summary
A company, MapBox, provided us with the task of creating a custom map using Leaflet, Json, and API calls. The earthquake data was obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey website with information about different worldwide earthquakes over the past week. All of this information was extracted for us and loaded as a GeoJson file. The resulting final map contained all the data collected represents as circular markers with varying size and color to show the magnitude of the different quakes. 


## Challenge Summary

Part of this challenge was to see the correlation between the tectonic plates and earthquakes recorded on a map to make it easy to see how related these two things are. Using this map we can toggle the visibility of the fault lines as well as the earthquake data. The three layers available are steet view, satellite, and light.
